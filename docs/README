Virtual Jaguar v1.0.0 GCC/SDL release README
--------------------------------------------

- DISCLAIMER -

Ported by SDLEMU (Niels Wagenaar & Caz) and is based upon the original work
from Potato Emulation. For requirements please consult the INSTALL file for
more information about supported OS' and software requirements.

The use of this software is entirely at your own risk. We can't be held
responsible for damage done to you hard- and/or software. This software
requires the use of the Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM and/or Commercial ROM
images. You may only use the ROM images if you own the cartridges itself.
The use of Commercial ROM's without owning the original cartridge is 
illegal in most countries and could result in fines and/or legal actions.

This software is released under the GPL license. For more information I
should direct you to the GPL.TXT. You may hack/change the code anyway you
like. You may not commercially sell this software. 

If you make changes, release the sourcecode to the public and send us the
changes you made to the original authors. 

The products and brands used in these documents and/or sourcecode are owned

- What is Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL?

Virtual Jaguar is software dedicated to emulate the Atari Jaguar hardware
on you standard P.C. The software was originally developed by Potato Emulation
(http://potato.emu-france.com) and was released under the GPL license on
25 June 2003. 

Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL is a port of the MS Visual C++/SDL sourcecode so that
we can enjoy Atari Jaguar emulation on every platform which uses the GCC
compiler and what can make use of the Simple Directmedia Layer library (SDL).

Currently Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL compiles on WIN32, using mingw, and several
UN*X based systems (BeOS, Linux and FreeBSD). It may run on other systems
as well but we can not garantee that.

The port was done by the SDLEMU crew (http://sdlemu.ngemu.com) and especially
by Niels Wagenaar and Caz. You may contact us by e-mail (sdlemu@ngemu.com) or
leave a message on the SDLEMU Official Forum (see the website).

More information about SDL can be found at http://www.libsdl.org.

- Using Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL

After compiling the binary (see INSTALL) you can now run original Atari Jaguar
games. These games are distributed on cartridges and can there for not be used
on a P.C. To use these games on Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL you need to get ROM
images. Besides that ROM imgaes from Commercial games you must also obtain the
Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM which you must copy to the BIOS directory. 
For legal issues concerning ROM images please consult the DISCLAIMER at the
beginning of this file.

After obaining the Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM and several ROM's you can now
use Virtual Jaguar using the following command :

./jag_em romfile -switch

The context of ROMFILE is the filename of the UNCOMPRESSED Atari Jaguar ROM
dump. You can also use switches. By just typing ./jag_em you get an overview
of the options you can use. WIN32 users should look into the stdout.txt for
that information.

If you succesfully start the emulator with the game you should see a window
(or fullscreen) which shows the game. If the game doesn't comply to a CRC
check the game will display a black screen, this means that the game is 
probably a hack or a new game which isn't supported. You may add the CRC
check to the sources yourself (src/crc32.cpp).

This emulator also emulates the Atari Jaguar Analog gamepads. By using the
following keyboard or joystick settings you can (possibly) play the game :

Atari Button A       : Z or joystick button 1
Atari Button B       : X or joystick button 2
Atari Button C       : C or joystick button 3
Atari Buttons 1 - 10 : Keypad 0 - 9 (0 = 10)
Atari Start/Pause    : ENTER
Atari Select         : TAB
Atari UP             : UP    or joystick UP
Atari DOWN           : DOWN  or joystick DOWN
Atari LEFT           : LEFT  or joystick LEFT
Atari RIGHT          : RIGHT or joystick RIGHT

With ESC you can easily stop Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL which will get you back
to you command prompt. If you want to change the key layout, simply hack the
src/joystick.cpp and change the keys :)
