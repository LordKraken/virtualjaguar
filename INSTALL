Virtual Jaguar v1.0.0 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
---------------------------------------------

- Requirements :

To compile Virtual Jaguar you need to check if you have the minimum
requirements for compiling the sources :

- GCC v2.95 of v3.x;
- SDL v1.2.5 or higher;
- nasm v0.98.x or higher;
- supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw);
  other OS' may work to but you may need to change some items
  in the Makefile(s).

Optionally you need a Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM which is available
on the Internet. We can't include the boot ROM since it's still
copyrighted.

Also, I would recommend that you have at least 20MB of free space.
The .o's can be quite big and the binary is likely to be about a
1.5MB in size (with UPX or strip this could downsize to about 800K).

- Compiling  :

If you sure you have the minimum software requirements, you can safely
compile Virtual Jaguar v1.0.0 GCC/SDL release by doing the following :

1) On UN*X systems first do the command : sh ./fix-unix.sh
2) Go to the src/star026c directory and start on of the scripts :

   ./build_s68000.win32 (for WIN32 systems with mingw)
   ./build_s68000.unix  (for UN*X  systems with gcc)

3) After the generation of the 68000.o file, you can now compile the
   program with the following commands :

   make -f Makefile.win32 (for WIN32 systems with mingw)
   make -f Makefile.unix  (for UN*X  systems with gcc)

4) Optionally you can manually strip jag_em[.exe] to downsize the binary.

 
That's it! You're done! You can now start the emulator with ./jag_em[.exe].
See the output for more details or consult the docs/README for more info.
