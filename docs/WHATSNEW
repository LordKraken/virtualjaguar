Virtual Jaguar v1.0.3 GCC/SDL - source only release
------------------------------------------------------

* Converted GNU assembly in the GPU core to C code -- Rayman and
  Alien vs Predator work again. :-)
* Removed closed source Starscream and replaced it with the open source
  Musashi core. Because of this, VJ runs a little faster now. :-)
* Various cleanups to the source files (still lots of work to do!)

NOTE: Tested only on WIN32 platform!

1.0.1 - 1.0.2 - Unreleased, mostly for testing/finding bugs
